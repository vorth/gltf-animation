This is a test project, demonstrating the ability to view Blender animations
in the web.

The simple torus animation was created in Blender, and exported to glTF 2.0 with
animations included.  The [X_ITE viewer](https://create3000.github.io/x_ite/) loads the model correctly, but I don't see
a way to play the animation, yet.
