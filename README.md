# gltf-animation

This is a test project, demonstrating the ability to view Blender animations
in the web.

In `index.html`, the simple torus animation was created in Blender, and exported to glTF 2.0 with
animations included.  The [X_ITE viewer](https://create3000.github.io/x_ite/) loads the model correctly,
and displays a menu of animations available for the model.

[Holger Seelig](https://github.com/create3000) has been very helpful, sharing sample code and explanations of X_ITE.
I've copied code from his [`gltf-sample-viewer`,](https://github.com/create3000/x_ite/tree/main/docs/assets/laboratory/gltf-sample-viewer).
